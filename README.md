# neco-vim as Omni completion function

This fork was created to register neco-vim as an omnifunc for vimscript. Just add this repository as a vim plugin with
your favorite plugin manager - that's it. It also works out of the box with YouCompleteMe since YCM picks up Omni
completion functions automatically.

Thanks to tracyone. This plugin is inspired by his vim configuration [t-vim](https://github.com/tracyone/t-vim).
